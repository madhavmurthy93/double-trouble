<h1>Doing another major or minor with Bioengineering</h1>

We have created a tool for Bioengineering undergraduate students at UW who are considering pursuing either another major or a minor. We hope this tool will share details about the coursework, workload, and background required to pursue another degree and provide you with the contact information to reach out to students from previous years who have done the same. These are the list of majors/minors that we think would be most beneficial to Bioengineering students:
<a href="#biochem">Biochemistry</a>
<a href="#bioethics">Bioethics &amp; Humanities</a>
<a href="#bio">Biology</a>
<a href="#chem">Chemistry</a>
<a href="#cheme">Chemical Engineering</a>

<a href="#me">Mechanical Engineering</a>
<a href="#microbio">Microbiology</a> 
<a href="#neurobio">Neurobiology</a>

<!-- Biochemistry -->
<h2 id="biochem">Biochemistry</h2>

The skills learned in the biochemistry department are likely very similar to those offered within the bioengineering program. The primary benefit of adding Biochemistry as a second major will be to show additional expertise in both chemistry and biology.

<!-- Microbiology -->  
<h2 id="microbio">Microbiology</h2>

Bioengineering students interested in research centered on infectious diseases or other topics concerned with microorganisms could pursue either a major or a minor in microbiology. Microbiology coursework can complement a background in Bioengineering nicely - as the core curriculum does not entail wet bench-top work.
