<h1>Doing another major or minor with Bioengineering</h1>

We have created this tool to assist Bioengineering undergraduate students at UW who are interested in pursuing another major or minor in addition to Bioengineering. This tool details the coursework, workload, and background required to pursue another degree. We also have provided the contact information to reach out to Bioengineering students from previous years who have pursued additional majors or minors. These are the list of majors/minors that we think are most relevant to Bioengineering students:
<a href="#biochem">Biochemistry</a>
<a href="#bioethics">Bioethics &amp; Humanities</a>
<a href="#bio">Biology</a>
<a href="#chem">Chemistry</a>

<a href="#me">Mechanical Engineering</a>
<a href="#microbio">Microbiology</a> 
<a href="#neurobio">Neurobiology</a>

<!-- Biochemistry -->
<h2 id="biochem">Biochemistry</h2>

The skills learned in the biochemistry department are likely very similar to those offered within the bioengineering program. The primary benefit of adding Biochemistry as a second major will be to show additional expertise and perhaps demonstrate specific bench-top skills.

<!-- Microbiology -->  
<h2 id="microbio">Microbiology</h2>

Bioengineering students interested in research centered on infectious diseases or other topics concerned with microorganisms could pursue either a major or a minor in microbiology. Microbiology coursework can complement a background in Bioengineering nicely - as the core curriculum does not entail wet bench-top work.
